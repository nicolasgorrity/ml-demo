Implementation and demos of machine learning algorithms

## Usage
Algorithms were implemented in Python3. Compatibility with Python2 is possible but not guaranteed.

Python libraries such as numpy were used for various mathematics and matrix manipulations.

## Purpose
These scripts are demos of widely used methods in machine learning.

They intend to help the reader understanding the algorithms and the influence of the various parameters by adjusting them in the code.

Displays and animations were also worked in order to be as educational as possible.
