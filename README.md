# ml-demo
Implementation and demos of machine learning algorithms

## Dependencies

Tested with `python3.6`.

Setup your virtual environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Purpose
These scripts are demos of widely used methods in machine learning.

They intend to help the reader understanding the algorithms and the influence of the various parameters by adjusting them in the code.

Displays and animations were also worked in order to be as educational as possible.
